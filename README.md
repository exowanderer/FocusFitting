# FocusFitting

## Work in Progress

Quadratic fitting routine for focus drifts on ground based telescopes.
  - tested on Kuiper 61" telescope data with manual table entries

Initiallially requires table of focusing position and PSF widths

Development will deploy with determination of PSF widths

Possibly can use header files to determine focus position and automate the entire process
